---

## [0.3.1] - 2025-12

### Added
- Export module refactoring: `LaneBuilder`, `SignalBuilder`, `ObjectBuilder`
- Graphics module extraction: `orbit/gui/graphics/`
- 12 new unit tests for road section boundary management

### Fixed
- Virtual junction export bug

---

## [0.3.0] - 2025-12

### Added
- Junction support with connecting roads
- Lane-to-lane connection mappings
- OpenDRIVE export with `<connection>` and `<laneLink>` elements
- Automatic connection generation from OSM imports
- Visual connection display in GUI
- Junction groups (roundabout, complexJunction, highwayInterchange)

---

## [0.2.0] - 2025-11

### Added
- OSM Import feature via Overpass API
- Highway types → OpenDRIVE road types mapping
- Lane configuration from OSM tags
- Turn lanes and turn restrictions
- Surface materials import
- Traffic signals and signs import
- Uncertainty analysis with Monte Carlo simulation
- GCP suggestions for optimal control point placement
- Uncertainty overlay visualization

---

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10

### Added
- Initial release
- PyQt6-based GUI for road annotation
- Polyline drawing and editing
- Road grouping with lane sections
- Junction management
- Georeferencing with control points
- OpenDRIVE 1.7 XML export
- Project save/load (.orbit JSON format)

---

## Known Limitations

- Undo/redo partially implemented — covers most operations but not all side effects (e.g., junction cleanup after road deletion)
- Single-image projects only (no multi-image mosaics)
- GUI code has low test coverage
